What were the revenues before (pre-2020), during (2020-2021), and after (2022 - current) Covid-19?
The data shows a drop in revenue for movie theaters during the pandemic, and a steady but slow growth in the years after. During these years the industry only reported a fraction of proceeds from previous years. However, streaming service subscribers kept going up. 

Did Covid-19 lead to changes in audience preferences and viewing habits?
The COVID-19 pandemic had an incredible influence on a lot of aspects in our daily lives. One of those things was preferences, viewing habits and behaviors.  As social restrictions were lifted it is shown that the vast populace still preferred to be solitary, with most preferring to watch new releases at home.

How did this affect the streaming industry?
The pandemic had a massive and immediate impact on streaming services. Contrary to the devastating damage the pandemic had on theater ticket revenue, it had a vastly positive effect on streaming as a whole by causing huge spikes in streaming numbers such as revenue and subscribers.

In conclusion, we can confidently say the pandemic caused by Covid-19 had a lasting impact in preferences and opinions around the United States. 

As the data reveals, people have continued to favor streaming services over going to the movies. Three years after the pandemic, ticket sales and revenue of movie theaters havenâ€™t gone back to its pre-pandemic days. Even though ticket sales and revenue is trending upward, we can see people are continuing to lean on the convenience of streaming services. 

The data provides strong evidence that some changes brought on following the pandemic, primarily caused by the vast restrictions on daily life it came with, may be permanent. Movie theaters may have a future up in the air while streaming, as a whole, will continue to expand.
